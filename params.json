  "body": "This module contains Powershell cmdlets for ActiveXperts Network Monitor application.  I originally developed this as I wanted to script placing the rules and monitors into maintenance mode so they wouldn't flood my email during a deployment.  After finding nothing helpful online, I stumbled upon some examples included with the software.  From there it was only a matter of finding the correct .Net modules and running with it.\r\n\r\nEnjoy\r\n\r\nJeff",
